# Planning Phase Instructions

**Goal:** Establish a clear implementation plan.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Analyze the User's Input:**
    *   **Scenario A (Vague/Empty):** If the user just says "start", "let's go", or provides no specific details, **STOP**. Ask the user: "What would you like to build? Please describe the features or goal."
    *   **Scenario B (Detailed):** If the user has already provided a description or a plan, **VALIDATE** it. Check if it covers backend and frontend requirements.

2.  **Generate/Refine Plan:**
    *   If Scenario A: Wait for user input, then create the plan.
    *   If Scenario B: Use the provided details to structure the formal plan. Fill in any missing technical details (dependencies, data models, API endpoints).

3.  **Output:**
    *   Produce the final plan in the requested output file.
    *   Break down features into tasks
    *   Identify dependencies
    *   Estimate complexity
    *   Create actionable steps for Backend and Frontend
